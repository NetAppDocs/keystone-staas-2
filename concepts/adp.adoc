You can subscribe to the advanced data protection add-on service as a part of your Keystone STaaS subscription. This add-on service leverages NetApp MetroCluster technology to ensure efficient data protection of your mission-critical workloads at a recovery point objective (RPO) of 0.

[NOTE]
Keystone STaaS standard services for file and block storage offer default data protection services by leveraging NetApp technologies, such as SnapMirror, SnapVault, and Snapshot. 

For information about the standard and cloud service, see link:../concepts/supported-storage-services.html[Keystone STaaS services].

Keystone advanced data protection service can synchronously mirror data to a secondary site. In case of a disaster at the primary site, the secondary site can take over, without any loss of data. This feature leverages the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster[MetroCluster] configuration between two sites to enable data protection. You can avail the advanced data protection add-on services for only your file and block storage services. As a part of this add-on service, the `Advanced Data-Protect` performance service level is assigned to your subscription.

== Pricing and charging

##The advanced data protection add-on service is priced and charged based on the committed capacity at each site. This helps determine the actual cost of advanced data protection service in $/TiB. The add-on charges apply to all capacities in your subscription, including source data, mirrored copies, and unmirrored data.##

##For MetroCluster configurations, the usage measurement works differently. Since only half of the storage at each site is actively used while the other half serves as backup, the total usage cost of the advanced data protection service is split across both sites. For example, if you have a MetroCluster setup with 100 TiB of committed capacity at Site A and 100 TiB at Site B, only 100 TiB is actively used across both sites. This means 50 TiB at each site is used for active data, with the remaining 50 TiB at each site serving as mirrored backup. The advanced data protection add-on charges are calculated based on this 100 TiB of actual usage, not the total 200 TiB of physical storage.##

##Note the following:##

* ##The service uses 100% of the committed capacity on associated storage as committed capacity.##
* ##Charges apply to both primary and secondary sites, covering both source and destination clusters.##
* ##Charges apply only to your file and block storage services.##

The following MetroCluster scenarios are supported:
